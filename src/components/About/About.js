          <p>
            Iâ€™m a former wine guy turned web developer. I left the wine business
            to take some time to travel and found myself in web development. I
            love programming and the endless possibilities (and challenges!)
            that come with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently work mostly with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express,
            React, Node), but am always looking forward to learning new
            languages and technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to utilize my diverse skill set to build applications that
            find a balance between people and product.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for stopping by and feel free to reach out! Cheers!</p>
